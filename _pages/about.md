<h2> Greetings! </h2>

I recently graduated from the University of Maryland and will begin my postdoc at Cornell University this summer. Beyond academia, I've consulted internationally for the World Bank and previously served as an associate director at Indonesia's Presidential Office (UKP4). 

Through research, I aspire to bridge two fields within public policy: sustainability and public budgeting. My dissertation, "Essays on Natural Disasters and Fiscal Resilience," empirically studies how environmental shocks like weather-related disasters affect state governments' finances, and what actions governments should take to maintain fiscal resilience and sustainability.
