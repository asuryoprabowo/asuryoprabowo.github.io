<h2> Greetings! </h2>

I earned my PhD in Policy Studies from the University of Maryland and a masterâ€™s degree in public policy from the University of Chicago. Beyond academia, I've previously served as an Associate Director at Indonesia's Presidential Office (UKP4) and consulted internationally for the World Bank. I will begin my postdoc at Cornell University this summer.

Through research, I aspire to bridge two fields within public policy: sustainability and public budgeting. My dissertation, "Essays on Natural Disasters and Fiscal Resilience," empirically studies how environmental shocks like weather-related disasters affect state governments' finances, and what actions governments should take to maintain fiscal resilience and sustainability.
