<h2> Greetings! </h2>

I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Einaudi Center for International Studies' Southeast Asia Program (SEAP) at Cornell University, where I also teach a course on sustainable finance at the Cornell Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy. I am currently on the 2024-25 job market.

My research agenda aims to bridge three policy areas: sustainability, infrastructure, and public budgeting/finance. Supported by the Graduate School Dean's Fellowship and the Ann G. Wylie Dissertation Fellowship, my [dissertation](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/items/f13a8fd1-29b3-4794-bb0f-bf9caaf5f483) investigated how environmental shocks like flooding and hurricanes affect American state governments' finances. During the 2019 Indonesian presidential election, I was selected as a fellow in the Australian National University's [New Mandala](https://www.newmandala.org/introducing-the-new-mandala-indonesia-correspondent-fellows/) program to write about infrastructure policy. 

I received my PhD from the University of Maryland and a master's degree from the University of Chicago, both in public policy. Beyond academia, I have consulted internationally for the World Bank, USAID, and the Economist Intelligence Unit, and previously served as an Associate Director at Indonesia's Presidential Office (UKP4).
