<h2> Greetings! </h2>

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Southeast Asia Program (SEAP) at Cornell University. I also teach a new course, *Sustainable Finance: Southeast Asia and Global Perspectives*, in the Cornell Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy.

My research attempts to bridge two fields within public policy: sustainability and public budgeting/finance. Through my [dissertation](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/items/f13a8fd1-29b3-4794-bb0f-bf9caaf5f483), I investigate how environmental shocks like flooding and hurricanes affect American state governments' finances, and what can be done to maintain fiscal resilience and sustainability.

Beyond academia, I have consulted internationally for the World Bank and previously served as an associate director at Indonesia's Presidential Office (UKP4).
