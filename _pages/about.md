I recently graduated from the University of Maryland and will begin my postdoc at Cornell University this summer.

Through research, I aspire to bridge two fields within public policy: sustainability and public budgeting. My dissertation, "Essays on Natural Disasters and Fiscal Resilience," empirically studies how environmental shocks like weather-related disasters affect state governments' finances, and what actions governments should take to maintain fiscal resilience and sustainability.
