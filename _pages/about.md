<h2> Greetings! </h2>

I am an Assistant Professor of Public Policy at Monash University (Indonesia campus). 

My research agenda seeks to bridge two policy areas: sustainability and public budgeting/finance. In the context of climate change, insights from both fields are instrumental in helping our society achieve environmental sustainability without sacrificing fiscal sustainability. Building on this nexus, my dissertation investigates the fiscal implications of environmental shocks like flooding and hurricanes across 50 U.S. states. Currently, I am working on research projects that (1) examine the evolution of climate policy agendas in Southeast Asia and (2) explore feasible climate finance mechanisms as governments in the region, amid budget constraints, navigate the tension between fostering economic growth and protecting the environment.
 
I recently completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Cornell University, where I was affiliated with the Southeast Asia Program and taught a course on Sustainable Finance at the Brooks School of Public Policy. I received a PhD from the University of Maryland and a master's degree from the University of Chicago, both in public policy. Beyond academia, I have consulted internationally for the World Bank, USAID, and the Economist Intelligence Unit, and previously served as an Associate Director at Indonesia's Presidential Office (UKP4).
