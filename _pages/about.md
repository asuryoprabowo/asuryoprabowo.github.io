<h2> Greetings! </h2>

I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the Southeast Asia Program (SEAP) at Cornell University, where I also teach a course on sustainable finance at the Cornell Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy. I am on the 2024-25 job market.

My research attempts to bridge two fields within public policy: sustainability and public budgeting/finance. Through my [dissertation](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/items/f13a8fd1-29b3-4794-bb0f-bf9caaf5f483), I investigate how environmental shocks like flooding and hurricanes affect American state governments' finances, and what can be done to maintain fiscal resilience and sustainability.

I received my PhD from the University of Maryland and a master's degree from the University of Chicago, both in public policy. Beyond academia, I have consulted internationally for the World Bank, USAID, and the Economist Intelligence Unit, and previously served as an Associate Director at Indonesia's Presidential Office (UKP4).
