Graduated recently from the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, I have established myself as a scholar at the intersection of sustainability and public finance. 

My dissertation, "Essays on Natural Disasters and Fiscal Resilience," seeks to understand how environmental shocks like weather-related disasters affect state governments' finances, and what actions governments should take to maintain fiscal resilience and sustainability.
